The product form can be xml, pdf, application, etc.\n    LanguageChoose: In order to meet the needs of the user and make the generated program runnable, select the specific programming language of the program.\n    DesignReview: Based on the user's task, evaluate whether the currently proposed product form and programming language can complete the user's task through subsequent code programming. If it cannot be completed, execution will start again from DemandAnalysis.\n    Coding: In order to complete the user's needs, write one to multiple files.\n    CodeComplete: In order to meet the complete functions of the developed software, implement all methods in the file, and then output all codes according to the corresponding format.\n    Annotation: Add comments to the generated code file to explain the functions of the classes and functions in the code.\n    CodeConclusion: Read the code content, explain the main functions contained in the code, and give any potential errors.\n    CodeReviewComment: Check whether all classes in the code are referenced and whether there are no potential bugs. Provide a highest priority opinion on the code and give suggestions for repairs. If the code is perfect, return <INFO>Finished.\n    CommentJudgement: Make a judgment on the comments made based on the existing specifications and conclusions. The result of the judgment will determine whether the code needs to be changed.\n    CodeReviewModification: In order to make the software creative, executable and robust, modify the corresponding code with more comments, then output the complete code, and fix all errors according to the comments.\n    TestErrorSummary: Test existing software, and find and summarize the errors that cause problems based on the test report. \n    TestModification: Modify all problematic code based on the error summary, and output the code you fixed based on the test report and corresponding explanation.\n    EnvironmentDoc: Based on the provided code and file format, write the requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the normal operation of the project.\n    Manual: Use Markdown to write a manual.md file, which is a detailed user manual for using the software, including introducing the main functions of the software, how to install environmental dependencies, and how to use/play.\n    \n    <text>\n    The process is split into 2 parallel branches: \n    Afterwards, the process conducts the DemandAnalysis. \n    Subsequently, the process conducts the LanguageChoose.\n    Once all 2 branches were executed, the process continues. \n    -If it is necessary, the process conducts the DesignReview. \n    Next, the process conducts Coding. \n    -If it is necessary, the process conducts the CodeComplete.\n    -If it is necessary, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: \n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the Annotation. \n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the CodeconClusion. \n    Once all 2 branches were executed, the process continues. \n    If it is necessary, the process conducts the CodeReviewComment. \n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the CommentJudgement. \n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the CodeReviewModification. \n    -If it is necessary, the process conducts the TestErrorSummary. \n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the TestModification. \n    -If it is necessary, the process conducts the EnvironmentDoc.\n        \u00b7If it is necessary, the process conducts the Manual. \n    </text>\n    \n    First read the above process text carefully to understand the relationship between each activity,Then generate trace to meet the following requirements.\n    This trace should satisfy: \n    1.The output trace does not need to have all activities. \n    2.The activities must be selected from the existing fourteen activities and cannot be created by yourself. \n    3.Use -> to connect between activities. \n    4.The sorting order of activities should be as diverse as possible to reflect your wisdom.\n    5.Only response the trace and nothing else.\n    the output format is below, you should follow the output format strictly.        \n    ",
